# nlmcatxsl: NLM Catalog XML to HTML table - Serials records

This XML transformation (XSLT) file can be used to move a basic subset of fields from an NLM Catalog XML export, into a clean HTML table.

For serials only.

For example, 

- Go to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nlmcatalog/?term=diabetes
- In left nav filters, "Journals currently indexed in MEDLINE"
- Send To > File > XML

Run through an XML processor.
